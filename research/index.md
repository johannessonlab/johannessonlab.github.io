# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research Projects

We have several ongoing research projects at the Johannesson lab. The nature of our research means that boundaries between projects are not always clear, and overlaps often occur. Nevertheless, the main directions of our currently ongoing work are the following, in no particular order.

# Fungi of the Kiruna iron mine
The iron mine in Kiruna is contaminated by oil spills. The oil seems to be actively degraded within the mine, and we have isolated fungi from the mine that use oil as a carbon source for growth. The long-term aim of the project is to develop fungal strains for bioremediation of contaminated wastewater. In addition to oil, the mine is contaminated by heavy metals, which begs the question of how the present fungi deal with such toxic substances.

Some of the methods we use include metagenomics to characterize the fungal and bacterial communities of the mine, mass spectrometry to determine oil degradation, and differential gene expression analysis to find the underlying genetic mechanisms that enable oil degradation.

# Rise and fate of genetic variation
In this project, we use fairy rings of the basidiomycete _Marasmius oreades_ to investigate the rise and fate of new genetic variation. Fairy rings are caused by a fungal mycelium growing beneath the soil surface in a circular pattern. They are useful because it is easy to determine where a fungal individual starts and ends. By comparing the genome sequences of different fruiting bodies of a fairy ring, new mutations can be identified. We trace how mutations are distributed spacially, in large scale across the ring, and small scale within different fruiting body tissues, as well as temporally over the years.

The project deals with fundamental evolutionary questions such as how genetic variation is introduced into individuals and populations. In addition, we aim to answer more general questions about basidiomycete biology, such as the moment of germline definition, the prevalence of monokaryons and dikaryons in nature, among other things.

As a related project, we are zooming in on the genus _Marasmius_, with the aim to sequence a collection of new genomes, build a phylogeny of the genus, and explore mating system evolution.

# Genome evolution and genetic conflict in Sordariales
Sordariales is a large and diverse order within Ascomycota, that houses several of the best studied fungal taxa, including _Neurospora_ and _Podospora_. In this project we explore the evolution of many of the characteristics of Sordariales fungi. This project is one of the longest-running in the Johannesson lab, and as a consequence is very broad.

A well-known characteristic of Sordariales is the high prevalence of Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP). Here we explore how RIP has shaped the evolution of fungal genomes, and the arms-race between RIP and transposable elements (TEs). As an example, we have recently found that species in the model genus _Podospora_ differ in their load of TEs, where one species stands out by having different TEs in its centromere, while also having lost RIP function.

More generally, by using a phylogenomic approach, we reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of Sordariales, and use it to explore genome evolution in the order. One Sordariales family in particular, the Chaetomiaceae, host a high number of thermophilic species, and one aim of this project is to investigate a possible link between optimal growth temperature and different aspects of genome evolution. 

Previously, we have also taken a deep-dive into genetic conflict in the form of meiotic drive by spore killer phenotypes. We determined the genetic basis for spore killing, and investigated the evolution of the phenomenon across _Neurospora_ and _Podospora_.

# Methylation in Neurospora
Highly related to the Sordariales genome evolution project, we here explore methylation in _Neurospora_ in particular. While gene-body methylation in _Neurospora_ is low overall, some genic cytosines show conserved methylation between different _Neurospora_ species. In this project we aim to characterize the level of gene-body methylation, and why and how it has been conserved in the genus.

# True morels of Northern Europe
As a guest researcher in the lab, Xi-Hui is exploring the taxonomic diversity and mating systems of European true morels (_Morchella_). The project is a collaboration with Martin Ryberg at Uppsala university, where Xi-Hui is primarily hosted.
