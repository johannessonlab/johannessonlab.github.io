True morels (_Morchella_ spp.), one of the most popular edible fungi in the world due to their highly desirable flavor, belong to Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina, Pezizomycetes, Morchellaceae. Several species in _Morchella_ have been successfully and widely cultivated in East Asia. Mating system is the key determinant factor for fruiting and cultivation of mushrooms. Currently, our research mainly focus on mating systems, life cycle and species diversity of _Morchella_ to improve our knowledge about their basic biology and further promote cultivation technology. The project is a collaboration with Martin Ryberg at Uppsala University, where Xi-Hui is primarily hosted.
