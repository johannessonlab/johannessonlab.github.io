The allodiploid species _Verticillium longisporum_ is the causal agent of verticillium stem striping in crucifers. It originates from at least three independent hybridization events between two haploid _Verticillium_ species. We are studying the population structure and genome evolution of this important pathogen, in collaboration with plant pathologists at SLU, Uppsala.
