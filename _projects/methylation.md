Highly related to the Sordariales genome evolution project, we here explore methylation in _Neurospora_ in particular. We have gathered methylome information from multiple species and strains of _Neurospora_, grown in different conditions. The large-scale pattern of a link between sequence divergence and methylation-divergence is clear, but there is an unexpectedly high proportion of conserved methylated sites. While gene-body methylation in _Neurospora_ is low overall, some genic cytosines show conserved methylation between different _Neurospora_ species. In this project we aim to characterize the level of gene-body methylation, and why and how it has been conserved in the genus.
