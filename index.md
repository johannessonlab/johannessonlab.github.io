## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our lab conducts research using fungi as model systems to explore fundamental evolutionary questions such as individuality, genetic conflict, multilevel selection, and the drivers of genetic variation and adaptation. As tools we use a wide range of methods such as comparative genomics, metagenomics, population genetics, bioinformatics, and laboratory experiments.

Today, we are 14 members in the team. In addition to our PI, we are researchers, PhD-students, master students and support persons â€“ both for bioinformatics and laboratory work. We comprise a mix of Swedish and international team members, each with our own unique skillset.
