I joined the Hanna Johannesson lab in February 2023 to do my PhD in Evolutionary Biology. I have always had a broad interest for evolution, but for the past years I have been particularly interested in evolutionary processes in fungi. My research thus focuses on fungal evolution, more specifically basidiomycete evolution. The goal for my PhD is to explore the lifecycle of the _Marasmius oreades_ (scotch bonnet), specifically focusing on when in the lifecycle genetic variation arises and how it is inherited.
