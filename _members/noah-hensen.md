I started my PhD with Hanna Johannesson in September 2021. I have a broad interest for mycological research and a strong passion for filling in the existing gaps in knowledge in the fungal kingdom. During my PhD studies I will research the phylogenetic relationship of the fungal order Sordariales. Furthermore, I will focus on one family within the order, Chaetomiaceae, to research how thermophilia affects genomic properties and fungal mutation rates. The ultimate aim of the project is to increase knowledge on the intrinsic mechanisms that define the tempo of evolutionary change, and to expand our knowledge on how adaptation to extreme environments affect the way in which the genome evolves.
