I'm a theoretical biologist interested in modelling the interplay between ecology and evolution, using the framework of evolutionary invasion analysis and individual-based simulations.
During my PhD, I developed and analysed mathematical models to understand various forms of divergent evolution. My work focused on both genetic diversity, specifically exploring scenarios where alternative alleles can provide complementary functionalities resulting in heterozygote advantage, as well as the evolution of the initial sexual dimorphism of anisogamy.
Currently, in my Postdoc at Hanna Johannessonâ€™s lab, I investigate the evolutionary dynamics of nuclei interactions in fungi by utilizing mathematical models within an evolutionary invasion analysis framework. First off, I aim to study the evolutionary processes underpinning a transition in individuality in the fungus _Neurospora tetrasperma_, which has recently evolved from homokaryosis to heterokaryosis. This study aims to clarify how nuclear cooperation can influence evolutionary transitions in fungi, potentially identifying mechanisms applicable for understanding other transitions of individuality.
