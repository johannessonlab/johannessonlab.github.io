I am professor in mycology. I am the holder of the [Bergianus professorship](https://www.kva.se/en/about-us/organisation/institutes-and-academy-programmes/), appointed by the [Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences](https://www.kva.se/en/) and with placement at [DEEP](https://www.su.se/department-of-ecology-environment-and-plant-sciences/). I established my own independent research group at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en) in 2005, after a PhD at the Swedish Agricultural University and a postdoc at University of California at Berkeley. I achieved an Associate Professorship (docentur) in 2006 and between 2007 and 2013 I held a senior research position (rådsforskartjänst) funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR). Since December 2013 I am a full professor.

My interest is broadly defined, and found in the interface of mycology and evolutionary biology.
