I am at the Johannesson lab to carry out my final research project for my master's in Fungal Biology. I am a student from Utrecht University, the Netherlands, and I am excited to be in Stockholm for 6 months! I previously worked as a research technician in immunology for almost 5 years, but my interest in academic research and fungi motivated me to pursue a master's. My current project focuses on using bioinformatics analyses to identify conserved histone variants across different fungal species and to explore the distribution of histone modifications in mushroom tissues.
