  - Fairy ring fungi
---

I joined the Johannesson lab in April 2025 to do my master thesis in Ecology. I am originally from Maastricht in the Netherlands, and I did my bachelor in Rotterdam. Last year, I moved to Stockholm for the Ecology and Biodiversity master there. My thesis work will be on the effect of fairy ring fungi on the microbiome in grass. I love fungi, so this seemed like the perfect project to combine that with ecology!
