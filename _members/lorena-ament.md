I am an evolutionary biologist interested in genome architecture and evolution, speciation, and biodiversity. I did my PhD in Hanna’s group from 2015 till 2020, working on the genetics and population dynamics of fungal meiotic drive elements (the Spore killers) in Podospora fungi. I have also worked on the evolution of reproductive systems in lichens, as well as the dynamics of adaptation in yeast experimental evolution settings. Currently, I hold an International Postdoc Grant from the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet). My project aims at characterizing the function and evolution of a special gene family known as NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in Podospora. In addition to their normal function (e.g. vegetative incompatibility and potentially fungal immunity), some NLRs have pleiotropic effects on sexual compatibility. I want to explore any potential contribution of NLRs to the buildup of reproductive isolation between fungal species.
