Lore is an evolutionary biologist interested in genome architecture and evolution, speciation, and biodiversity. She did her PhD in Hanna's group from 2015 till 2020, working on the genetics and population dynamics of fungal meiotic drive elements (the Spore killers) in Podospora fungi. She has also worked on the evolution of reproductive systems in lichens, as well as the dynamics of adaptation in yeast experimental evolution settings. Currently, Lore holds an International Postdoc Grant from the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet). Her project aims at characterizing the function and evolution of a special gene family known as NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in _Podospora_. In addition to their normal function (e.g. vegetative incompatibility and potentially fungal immunity), some NLRs have pleiotropic effects on sexual compatibility. Lore wants to explore any potential contribution of NLRs to the buildup of reproductive isolation between fungal species.
