I joined the Johannesson Lab for a masters internship. Before this, I worked on a masters project at the Fungal Genomics lab (Utrecht University), which further established my previous interest in fungi and their fascinating molecular mechanisms. I am mainly interested in gaining fundamental understanding about life and its mechanisms, and thus am also interested in evolutionary genomics. During my time in Stockholm, I will be working on the spore killer mechanism in _Neurospora sitophila_, mainly by focusing on analysis of population genomics data. I am hoping to contribute to the understanding of _N. sitophila_ population structure, and the underlying barriers that shape it.
