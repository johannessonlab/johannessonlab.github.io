I am a research assistant at the Johannesson lab. During my masters in Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences (Utrecht University) I have specialized in my main research interest: fungal genetics. After working on the regulation of mushroom formation in _Schizophyllum commune_ at Robin Ohm's lab (UU), I moved to Stockholm and started on a project with the Johannesson lab. Over a period of 6 months I looked into possible mechanisms for resistance to spore killing in _Neurospora sitophila_. Now, I am contributing to the study of genetic diversity in the fairy-ring mushroom _Marasmius oreades_.
