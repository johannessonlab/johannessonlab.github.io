In the beginning of 2024, Marieke came to Stockholm and the Johannesson lab. Over a period of 6 months she looked into possible mechanisms for resistance to spore killing in Neurospora sitophila, as a part of her master. After that, she stayed on for another 6 months to help out in the study of genetic diversity in the fairy-ring mushroom Marasmius oreades.
