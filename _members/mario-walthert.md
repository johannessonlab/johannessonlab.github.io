After finishing my Bachelor at the Institute for Plant Science in Bern (Switzerland), I moved to Stockholm for my Master studies. After mainly working with plants, my goal was to delve deeper into the fascinating realm of fungi. Concretely, I have a strong interest in how to apply them biotechnologically, e.g. in food industry or bioremediation. In my Master project, I cultivate fungi from nature and initiate mushroom formation under laboratory conditions. Besides its use for food industry, this procedure is also important for studying model organisms such as _Marasmius oreades_.
