I am a postdoc at Hanna Johannesson’s group in the Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences, where I study fungal-algal symbioses, known as lichens. How is it possible that multiple microbes - fungi, algae, bacteria - self-assemble into a lichen, which is big, complex, and three-dimensional? How can symbiotic interactions lead to a stable body plan? How do lichen architectures develop and grow? To address these questions, I use meta-omics, microscopy, and cell biology tools. My ultimate goal is to study lichen symbiosis as a case of complexity arising in evolution. I did my previous postdoc at Nick Talbot’s group in The Sainsbury Lab (Norwich, UK) an my PhD in the Symbiosis & Evolution Lab at the University of Alberta (Canada).
