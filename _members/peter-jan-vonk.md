I am a molecular biologist interested in everything related to the genetics of mushroom-forming fungi. I completed my PhD at Utrecht University in 2022 with Robin Ohm. During my PhD I used a combination of molecular biology and bioinformatics approaches to study the transcriptional regulation of mushroom development in Schizophyllum commune. This included the development of the first general CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion method in a mushroom-forming fungus. After my PhD I did a two year postdoc in the same group. I joined the Johannesson lab in May 2024 to study genetic diversity in the fairy ring mushroom Marasmius oreades.
