I graduated as a PhD in 2021 at Uppsala university with Hanna Johannesson as main advisor. After a year as a postdoc with Fabien Burki at the same department, I am back in Hanna’s group since January 2023. My position is as a researcher at The Royal Academy of Sciences, with a placement at DEEP. My research area is mycological genetics, with a heavy emphasis on evolution, and to answer my scientific questions I employ bioinformatical genome analysis. I have a broad interest in evolution, in particular of fungi, but also of the great diversity of wondrous organisms and their genomes.
