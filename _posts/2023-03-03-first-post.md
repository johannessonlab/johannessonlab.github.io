We are very excited to launch our new lab web page! Stay tuned to this site for bigger announcements about what's going on at the Johannesson lab. Follow us also on twitter for our day-to-day activities.

The site was developed from the [lab website template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template), and it has been a pleasure to use it. In the future we are looking to change the domain name, but there will be a separate announcement of that.
