Hanna and Peter Jan went to Lund to attend the Fungal Genetics symposium arranged by The Mendelian Society and the Royal Physiographic Society of Lund. In association to the symposium, Dr N. Louise was awarded a prestigious medal. Hanna gave a talk and the symposium, and the trip included visits to the groups of Edith Hammer (for which Peter Jan gave a talk) and Dimitri Floudas. We had a great trip full of fungal genetics and networking!
