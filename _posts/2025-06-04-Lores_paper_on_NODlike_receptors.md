Innate immunity relies on specialized receptors (like the NOD-like ones) to detect pathogens and trigger defense responses, but their repetitive nature has hindered functional and evolutionary analyses. Here, Lore shows that the repeats of the WD40 domain, evolving under concerted and diversifying selection, can be accurately reconstructed from long read sequencing.
