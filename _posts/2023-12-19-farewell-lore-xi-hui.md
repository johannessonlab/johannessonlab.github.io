This week, we said farewell to Lore, who will move to France for her VR-funded postdoc work, and to Xi-Hui, who went back to China to continue working with the morels back home. Xi-Hui brought us to the best Chinese restaurant in Uppsala, so we got some good food while wishing them good fortune for the next moves!
