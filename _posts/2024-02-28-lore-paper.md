One more piece of work from Lore's PhD-thesis is published in Genome Biology and Evolution. Here, we present chromosome-level assemblies of the remaining species of the _Podospora_ species complex and make an attempt to resolve their phylogenetic relationships. Lore's work has really contributed to making _Podospora_ a fine model system for the study of genome evolution! [Read the paper here](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae034)!
