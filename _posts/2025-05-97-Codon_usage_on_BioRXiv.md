Our study on the codon usage in the fungal order Sordariales is now available at BioRXiv! It contributes to the understanding of fungal genome evolution in the order, and is valuable for inferring evolutionary trajectories of genomes and protein-coding genes. I can also have potential future biotechnological applications in e.g., increasing heterologous expression of important secondary metabolites in this important group of fungi.
