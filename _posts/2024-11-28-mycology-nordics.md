We are hosting the first Mycology Nordics conference this week. This meeting is not just a scientific meeting, itâ€™s also a vision to generate a future network of mycologists from the Nordics with the research interest in ecology, evolution and genetics of fungi. The interest for the meeting was greater than we had hoped for! - so now we have about 100 participants from around the Nordics joining us. Lots of work, and lots of new friends! Go, mycology, go!
