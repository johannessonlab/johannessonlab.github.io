Today we meet with the so-called Humongous fungus group, which is a network that brings together mycologists from Uppsala and Stockholm Universities. Looking forward to hear many interesting talks today about cutting-edge fungal research. In the evening we have a joint celebration for today's event and Ivar's halftime defence that took place yesterday, with a potluck party and pub!
