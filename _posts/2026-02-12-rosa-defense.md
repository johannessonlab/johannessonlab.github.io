Today Rosa van Zandvoort successfully defended her master thesis "The impact of Marasmius oreades fairy rings on the soil microbiome and physicochemical properties"! It turned out to be an ambitious and comprehensive study, including all from study design, field-sampling, different types of laboratory work, data crunching, interpretations and writing. Definitely worth a masters-degree! Congratulations, Rosa!
