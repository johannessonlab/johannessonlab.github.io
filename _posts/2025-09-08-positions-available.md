We have several open positions in my group, funded from the ERC Advanced Grant ”FUNGERM” - on the Early Sequestered Germline of Fungi. We will recruit PhD-students, postdoc(s) and a research engineer. We search broadly for applicants with a dedicated interest in fungal evolutionary biology, and are in particular encouraging applicants with a background in molecular biology and microscopy to apply.
 
Please forward to possible candidates, and RT!
