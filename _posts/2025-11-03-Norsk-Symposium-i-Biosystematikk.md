Markus and Rosa went to Trondheim, for the "Norsk Symposium i Biosystematikk". Markus gave the keynote lecture on our recent findings of inheritance in basidiomycetes and Rosa gave a shorter talk on the microbiome associated with the fairy ring forming _Marasmius oreades_. Rosa won a price for her talk!
