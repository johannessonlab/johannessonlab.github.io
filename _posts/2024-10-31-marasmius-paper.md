Markus got the manuscript  ”Evolution of a bipolar sexual compatibility system in Marasmius” accepted for publication in Mycologia. A project started long a go - and finished recently. We show that Marasmius obeys to the typical Agaricomycete way to evolve bipolarity from tetrapolarity - by loss of mating compatibility function of the P/R locus.
