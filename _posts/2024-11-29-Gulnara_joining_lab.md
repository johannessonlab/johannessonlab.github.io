Good news! Gulnara got a two-year scholarship from the Wenner-Gren foundation to join us for working on lichens: She will dive into how different symbionts recognize each other and the role that immunity plays in the symbiosis. The yellow Xanthoria will be her model lichen. She will start after summer of 2025.
