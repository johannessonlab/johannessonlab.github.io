This week, our group attends the International Mycological Congress in Maastricht. We find out what's new in mycology and also present our own research: Hanna gives a keynote and Noah gives a session talk on the genomics of Chaetomiaceae. Markus, Jesper, Boel, Petter and Marion show posters. And, of course, we all take this opportunity to hang out with our old and new friends and colleagues.
