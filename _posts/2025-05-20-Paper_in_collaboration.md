Our paper ”Genomic organization, domain assortments, and nucleotide-binding domain diversity of NLR proteins in Sordariales fungi” was accepted in PLoS Genetics. We joined this study as collaborators with Pierre Gladieux’s team in Montpellier. The work highlights the similarity of fungal and animal NLRs in terms of nucleotide-binding domain types, and between fungal and plant NLRs in terms of genomic organization in clusters.
