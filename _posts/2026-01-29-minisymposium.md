One day before the PhD-defense by Noah Hensen, we arranged a minisymposium on Fungal Evolution, which started with a talk by Noah’s opponent, Antonis Rokas, and was followed by talks by Inger Skrede (Oslo), Jennifer Anderson (SLU, Uppsala), Marion Orsucci form our own group, and Rike Stelkens (Zoology, SU). It was a really great event with Vivi Täckholm-salen full of audience!
