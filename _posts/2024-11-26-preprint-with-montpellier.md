Fungal genomes harbor NOD-Like receptors (NLRs), which are analogous to the innate immune receptors found in animals, plants and bacteria. We collaborated with Pierre Gladieux and his group for an investigation of the variability of fungal NLR repertoires and the underlying determinants, in the ascomycete order Sordariales.
